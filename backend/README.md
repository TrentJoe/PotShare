# Backend Folder

This is where you'll build your Flask API!

## Structure (You'll create these as you learn)

```
backend/
├── app.py              ← Main Flask app (Step 1-4)
├── database.db         ← SQLite database (Step 5)
├── models/             ← Business logic (Step 6-7)
│   └── user.py
├── routes/             ← API endpoints (Step 8-16)
│   ├── auth.py
│   └── expenses.py
└── utils/              ← Helper functions (Step 11)
    └── auth.py
```

## Current Step: Building app.py

You already have `app.py` in the root folder. We'll move it here when you're ready!

## What You'll Learn

- **app.py** - Flask setup, routes, CORS
- **database.db** - SQLite database file
- **models/** - Functions that interact with database
- **routes/** - API endpoints (organized by feature)
- **utils/** - Helper functions (JWT, validation, etc.)
